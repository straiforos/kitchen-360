# Phase 1 Iterations

## Overview
This document tracks the iterations and thought process during Phase 1 development of the Kitchen 360째 Organizer. It serves as a living document to understand the evolution of our design decisions and implementation choices.

## Iteration 1: Initial Model Simplification (2024-04-06)

### Changes Made
1. **Model Structure**
   - Removed `ITEMS` table and related functionality
   - Simplified `HOTSPOTS` by removing `appearance` and `data` fields
   - Removed `metadata` from `ROOMS`
   - Changed `blobKey` to `imageUrl` in `VIEWS`

2. **Model Enhancements**
   - Added timestamps (`createdAt`, `updatedAt`) to all main entities
   - Added proper relationships between models
   - Added `ViewConnection` type with specific connection types
   - Enhanced `Position` model with longitude, latitude, and zoom

### Rationale
1. **Simplification Benefits**
   - Reduced complexity in data model
   - Improved performance with fewer nested structures
   - Easier serialization for storage and sharing
   - Clearer relationships between entities

2. **Enhanced Features**
   - Better position tracking for 360째 navigation
   - Improved view transitions with specific connection types
   - Timestamp tracking for better data management
   - More precise hotspot placement

### Impact on Core Features
1. **360째 Panorama Viewer**
   - Enhanced position tracking enables better navigation
   - Improved view transitions with specific connection types
   - Better support for zoom and orientation

2. **Hotspot Management**
   - Simplified hotspot model focuses on core functionality
   - Precise position tracking for accurate placement
   - Optional descriptions for rich content

3. **Multiple View Support**
   - Clear view-to-view connections
   - Specific transition types (door, archway, etc.)
   - Proper room-view relationships

## Iteration 2: Storage Areas and View Integration (2024-04-07)

### Changes Made
1. **Model Refinement**
   - Introduced `StorageArea` as a first-class entity
   - Integrated storage areas with Photo Sphere Viewer's marker system
   - Added support for open/closed states of storage areas
   - Enhanced view connections with specific types

2. **Type System Updates**
   - Added `StorageAreaType` (Cabinet, Drawer, Shelf, Custom)
   - Added `ViewConnectionType` (door, archway, opening, custom)
   - Enhanced `RoomType` and `RoomLayoutType` with specific values
   - Added proper relationships between entities

### Rationale
1. **Storage Area Integration**
   - Storage areas are now properly modeled as physical spaces
   - Each storage area can have an open and closed state
   - Better alignment with real-world kitchen organization
   - Clear separation between views and storage areas

2. **View System Enhancement**
   - Views now properly represent 360째 panoramas
   - Storage areas are positioned within views
   - Clear connections between views for navigation
   - Better support for room layout visualization

### Impact on Core Features
1. **Room Organization**
   - Clear representation of kitchen layouts
   - Proper categorization of storage spaces
   - Better support for different room types
   - Enhanced room description capabilities

2. **View Management**
   - Storage areas are now properly positioned in views
   - Support for viewing storage areas in open/closed states
   - Clear navigation between different views
   - Better spatial awareness in the room

3. **Storage Area Management**
   - Proper categorization of storage types
   - Support for custom storage areas
   - Clear positioning within views
   - Enhanced description capabilities

### Future Considerations
1. **Storage Area Features**
   - Consider adding inventory management
   - Evaluate need for storage area metadata
   - Consider adding storage area tags
   - Evaluate need for storage area organization

2. **View Enhancements**
   - Consider adding view thumbnails
   - Evaluate need for view metadata
   - Consider adding view tags
   - Evaluate need for view organization

## Next Steps
1. **Immediate Actions**
   - [ ] Implement the updated model in the codebase
   - [ ] Update storage adapters to handle new structure
   - [ ] Update UI components to reflect model changes
   - [ ] Implement storage area management UI

2. **Future Iterations**
   - [ ] Evaluate need for inventory management features
   - [ ] Consider adding metadata fields for customization
   - [ ] Implement tagging system for views and storage areas
   - [ ] Evaluate need for advanced storage area organization

## Lessons Learned
1. **Model Design**
   - Clear entity relationships are crucial
   - Proper type definitions improve maintainability
   - Timestamps are valuable for data management
   - Consider real-world use cases in design

2. **Implementation**
   - Type safety is important for model consistency
   - Clear interfaces make development easier
   - Documentation helps track design decisions
   - Consider future extensibility in design
