# Phase 1 Iterations

## Overview
This document tracks the iterations and thought process during Phase 1 development of the Kitchen 360° Organizer. It serves as a living document to understand the evolution of our design decisions and implementation choices.

## Iteration 1: Initial Model Simplification (2024-04-06)

### Changes Made
1. **Model Structure**
   - Removed `ITEMS` table and related functionality
   - Simplified `HOTSPOTS` by removing `appearance` and `data` fields
   - Removed `metadata` from `ROOMS`
   - Changed `blobKey` to `imageUrl` in `VIEWS`

2. **Model Enhancements**
   - Added timestamps (`createdAt`, `updatedAt`) to all main entities
   - Added proper relationships between models
   - Added `ViewConnection` type with specific connection types
   - Enhanced `Position` model with longitude, latitude, and zoom

### Rationale
1. **Simplification Benefits**
   - Reduced complexity in data model
   - Improved performance with fewer nested structures
   - Easier serialization for storage and sharing
   - Clearer relationships between entities

2. **Enhanced Features**
   - Better position tracking for 360° navigation
   - Improved view transitions with specific connection types
   - Timestamp tracking for better data management
   - More precise hotspot placement

### Impact on Core Features
1. **360° Panorama Viewer**
   - Enhanced position tracking enables better navigation
   - Improved view transitions with specific connection types
   - Better support for zoom and orientation

2. **Hotspot Management**
   - Simplified hotspot model focuses on core functionality
   - Precise position tracking for accurate placement
   - Optional descriptions for rich content

3. **Multiple View Support**
   - Clear view-to-view connections
   - Specific transition types (door, archway, etc.)
   - Proper room-view relationships

### Future Considerations
1. **Potential Extensions**
   - Consider adding hotspot types for better categorization
   - Evaluate need for room metadata for customization
   - Consider view tagging for better organization

2. **Storage Areas**
   - Implemented nullish coalescing for better default handling
   - Simplified area creation process
   - Clear type definitions

## Next Steps
1. **Immediate Actions**
   - [ ] Implement the simplified model in the codebase
   - [ ] Update storage adapters to handle new structure
   - [ ] Update UI components to reflect model changes

2. **Future Iterations**
   - [ ] Evaluate need for inventory management features
   - [ ] Consider adding metadata fields for customization
   - [ ] Implement tagging system for views

## Lessons Learned
1. **Model Design**
   - Simplicity often leads to better maintainability
   - Clear relationships are crucial for navigation
   - Timestamps are valuable for data management

2. **Implementation**
   - Type safety is important for model consistency
   - Clear interfaces make development easier
   - Documentation helps track design decisions
