# Phase 0: PhotoSphere Proof of Concept

## Overview
This document outlines a simplified proof of concept using PhotoSphere Viewer directly, without React, TypeScript, or complex state management. The goal is to quickly validate the core functionality of adding markers with photos and descriptions to a 360° image.

## Core Components

### PhotoSphere Viewer
- Direct integration of PhotoSphere Viewer library
- Basic marker system for points of interest
- Simple image upload and display

### Storage
- Local file system for images
- Basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript implementation
- No database or complex state management

## Implementation Details

### Basic Structure
```
public/
├── index.html
├── styles.css
├── script.js
└── images/
    └── 360-photos/
```

### Key Features
1. Single 360° image display
2. Click-to-add marker functionality
3. Basic marker form with:
   - Title
   - Description
   - Photo upload
4. Simple marker list view
5. Local storage for marker data

### Technical Stack
- Vanilla JavaScript
- PhotoSphere Viewer library
- HTML5/CSS3
- Local Storage API (for marker persistence)

## Implementation Flows

### Marker Creation
1. User loads 360° image
2. User clicks on desired location
3. Simple form appears for marker details
4. Marker is added to the view
5. Marker data is saved to local storage

### Image Management
- Images stored in local file system
- No complex blob management
- Direct file references

## Benefits of This Approach
1. Rapid prototyping
2. No complex build setup
3. Direct testing of core functionality
4. Easy to modify and iterate
5. Clear separation from future React/TypeScript implementation

## Limitations
1. No complex state management
2. Limited persistence (local storage only)
3. No type safety
4. Basic UI/UX
5. No advanced features like view connections

## Next Steps
1. Implement basic PhotoSphere integration
2. Add marker creation functionality
3. Implement local storage for markers
4. Create basic UI for marker management
5. Test core functionality
6. Document learnings for Phase 1 implementation
