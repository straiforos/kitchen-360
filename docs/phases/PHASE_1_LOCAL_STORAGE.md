# Phase 1: Local Storage MVP

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation details for Phase 1 of the Kitchen 360° Organizer, focusing on creating a functional prototype with local storage and blob storage for images.

## Core Components

### Storage Manager
The storage manager handles all data persistence using IndexedDB. See [IndexedDB Implementation](../src/services/storage/indexedDB.ts) for details.

### State Management
- React Context for global state
- Custom hooks for data management
- Local storage for persistence

### Viewer Integration
- Photo Sphere Viewer for 360° image display
- Local blob storage for images
- Basic plugin integration

## Implementation Details

### Storage Structure
The storage structure follows our [Data Models](../architecture/data-models/README.md) documentation. All data is stored in IndexedDB with the following structure:
- [Room](../src/types/Room.ts)
- [View](../src/types/View.ts) 
- [StorageArea](../src/types/StorageArea.ts)

## Implementation Flows

For detailed flow diagrams, see our [System Flows](../architecture/flows/README.md) documentation.

### Room Creation Flow
See [Room Creation Flow](../architecture/flows/README.md#room-creation-flow) for detailed sequence diagram.
1. User starts room creation
2. System validates room details
3. Room is saved to IndexedDB
4. Initial view is created and saved
5. Storage areas are added and saved

### View Creation Flow
See [View Creation Flow](../architecture/flows/README.md#view-creation-flow) for detailed sequence diagram.
1. User uploads 360° image
2. Image is stored as blob in IndexedDB
3. View details are saved
4. View connections are configured
5. View is added to room

### Storage Area Creation Flow
See [Storage Area Creation Flow](../architecture/flows/README.md#storage-area-creation-flow) for detailed sequence diagram.
1. User selects position in view
2. Storage area image is uploaded and stored
3. Storage area details are saved
4. Marker is added to view

### Image Management
See [Image Management Flow](../architecture/flows/README.md#image-management-flow) for detailed flow diagram.
- Images are stored as blobs in IndexedDB
- Blob URLs are cached in memory
- Unused blob URLs are revoked
- Memory usage is monitored

## Performance Considerations

### Blob Management
- Images are stored as blobs in IndexedDB
- Blob URLs are cached in memory
- Unused blob URLs are revoked
- Memory usage is monitored

### State Management
- State is persisted to IndexedDB
- Frequent updates are batched
- Memory state is kept in sync with storage

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Storage adapter tests
- Component tests
- Hook tests
- Utility function tests

### Integration Tests
- Room creation flow
- View creation flow
- Storage area management
- Image handling

## Next Steps
1. Implement basic storage adapters
2. Create core viewer component
3. Implement room creation flow
4. Add view creation functionality
5. Add storage area creation and management
6. Set up testing infrastructure
