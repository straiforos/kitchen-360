# Testing Guide

This guide provides an overview of the testing strategy for the Kitchen 360Â° Organizer project. For detailed information about specific testing types, please refer to the following guides:

- [Unit Testing Guide](UNIT_TESTING.md) - For isolated component testing
- [Integration Testing Guide](INTEGRATION_TESTING.md) - For component interactions and data flow

## Testing Philosophy

Our testing strategy follows these core principles:

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**
   - Test all critical functionality
   - Balance between unit and integration tests
   - Focus on user-facing features
   - Maintain high test quality

2. **Test Types**
   - Unit Tests: Isolated component testing
   - Integration Tests: Component interaction testing
   - Each type serves a distinct purpose

3. **Quality Assurance**
   - Automated testing for reliability
   - Consistent testing patterns
   - Regular test maintenance
   - Continuous improvement

## Testing Tools

- **Jest**: JavaScript testing framework
- **React Testing Library**: For testing React components
- **Jest DOM**: For DOM-specific testing utilities
- **MSW (Mock Service Worker)**: For API mocking
- **TypeScript**: For type checking

## Testing Commands

- `npm test`: Run all unit tests
- `npm run test:watch`: Run tests in watch mode
- `npm run test:coverage`: Generate test coverage report
- `npm run test:integration`: Run all integration tests
- `npm run test:integration:watch`: Run integration tests in watch mode

## Testing Workflow

1. **Development**
   - Write tests alongside code
   - Follow test-driven development when appropriate
   - Maintain test coverage
   - Keep tests up to date

2. **Code Review**
   - Review test coverage
   - Verify test quality
   - Check test maintainability
   - Ensure proper test organization

3. **Continuous Integration**
   - Automated test runs
   - Coverage reporting
   - Test result analysis
   - Quality gates

## Best Practices

1. **Test Organization**
   - Clear test structure
   - Consistent naming
   - Proper documentation
   - Logical grouping

2. **Test Quality**
   - Reliable tests
   - Clear assertions
   - Proper error handling
   - Meaningful test names

3. **Performance**
   - Fast test execution
   - Efficient test setup
   - Appropriate mocking
   - Resource management

4. **Maintainability**
   - Clean test code
   - Clear documentation
   - Regular updates
   - Consistent patterns

## Getting Started

1. **Setup**
   - Install dependencies
   - Configure testing tools
   - Set up test environment
   - Review testing guides

2. **Writing Tests**
   - Start with unit tests
   - Add integration tests
   - Follow best practices
   - Maintain test quality

3. **Running Tests**
   - Use appropriate commands
   - Monitor test results
   - Address failures
   - Maintain coverage
